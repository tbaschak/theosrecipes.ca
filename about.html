	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm Theodore Baschak and welcome to my food blog. Each week (or several times a month) I try out a new recipe and post it here to share it with the world. If you enjoy any of the recipes I post feel free to leave a comment.</p>

	<p>I currently live in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and learned to cook from my mother, father, wife, and various cooking shows on TV. My wife however has really inspired my passion for food, and has introduced me to many new cuisines. She also puts up with my experimentation in the kitchen.</p>

	<p>Full-time IT guy trying to cook more often, and maybe lose weight too.</p>

	<p>My method for devising recipes usually involves reading several recipes online, talking to other people who have cooked things like what I am trying to cook, and then making my own recipe based on what I am seeing and hearing. By recording what I find successful here, I hope that it will help you as well.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients in Winnipeg</h2>

	<p>Often when reading a recipe I come across an item that I have never heard of before. Sometimes these ingredients have multiple names, so it helps to search for a name that you may not be familiar with. I've had a lot of luck with the local Sobeys store by my house for a surprising number of items. </p>

	<p>For more obscure (or a wider variety of) ingredients I swear by <a href="http://www.dinosgrocerymart.com/">Dino's Grocery Mart</a> on Notre Dame Avenue. If you live in Winnipeg, many of the recipes may require a trek over to Dino's. </p>
