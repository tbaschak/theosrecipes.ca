A rich and spicy curry dish which often paired with rice. Lentils are a staple in India, and a relatively high source of vegetarian protein. The level of heat can be adjusted by using different peppers instead of Thai peppers.

Grinding your own curry spices in a mortal and pestle is an excellent way to mix them and get great uniform flavor.

Having the coconut milk ready to pour in once the curry spices are cooked with the onion and oil helps ensure you don't burn your mix.
