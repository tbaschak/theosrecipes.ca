    1. chop up red peppers into large pieces, enough to cover 1-2 baking sheets. Broil this in your oven until the skin gets burned a little and puffs up.
    2. put the peppers in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes to sit
    3. cook onion in butter in a dutch oven or large pot until translucent, adding garlic a few minutes after the onion
    4. add flour to onions, ensuring there is enough butter in the pot before you do this. Mix and form a bit of a roux
    5. add roasted red peppers, crushed tomatoes, vegetable broth, thmye, oregano, smoked paprika, fresh basil, and black/white pepper, and some salt at this point
    6. use immersion blender to blend soup, not to a fine puree, just so there are no pieces of anything left
    7. simmer for 20-30 minutes
    8. serve, garnish with fresh basil leaves & grated parmesan
